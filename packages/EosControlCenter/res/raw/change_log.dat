        · bump LeanKernel to 5.8.2exp1-230 from Imoseyon 

    • All
        · new Swipe to QuickSettings brought in from CM. Swipe
        · expanded statusbar drag handle to flip between QuickSettings
        · and Notification panels. It's pretty slick. 

TABLETS

    • TF101
        · Bring in extended BatteryController class to manage
          Dock battery 
        
        · Revert "mach-tegra: proper gpu overlocking"

ALL

    • New QuickSettings seekbar style and animation. Now fling open
      area of seekbar to scroll between volume and brightness. Much
      cleaner and sleeker.
    
    • Various backend code cleanup for various features and implementation.
    
    • Completely overhauled Systembar visibility code.
    
    • FEATURE: All device can now select to hide both bars, just hide 
      navigation bar and leave statusbar alone, and hide bars on boot. 
      NOTE: As always, the user may also hide bars from Power Menu, softkey
      longpress action, and custom Search Panel target action!
    
    • Introducing version 0.5a (lol) of the all new ECC (Eos Control Center)! 
      For now all users will use view pager in portrait and landscape orientation. 
      In time, tablets will use dual pane interface, large screen (grouper) will 
      use pager in portrait and dual pane in landscape, and phones will 
      use view pager for both. 
      
      Some things to note:
      
        · Some features have been reorganized. You won't have to look far for them.
        
        · Some various layouts are a work in progress. I already know what 
          they are so don't remind me!
        
        · Softkey settings: You can now apply one key's color or glow color to all 
          the keys or glows. With the push of a button. Should satisfy some 
          vocal users ;P
        
        · The ECC will continue to grow and evolve with the goal of the ECC 
          properly reflecting that TeamEos is a world class organization, and 
          the gateway to our features will reflect that.
          No need to wipe or anything else. All your settings are preserved.
