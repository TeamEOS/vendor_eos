ALL

  • Overhaul how UI modes are handled and controlled. All devices,
    all UI configurations.
    
  • Major bottom bar UI cleanup. Ticker is clean now, but could
    still use some polish. Most UI blemishes are clean now.
  
  • ECC - Navigation fragment now shows features contextually,
    based on current UI mode. Cap key devices - i know it's 
    a little empty in there. Rlasalle and RaymanFX have some 
    stuff coming. They promise ;D
    
  • Temporarily disable hide bars. I'm gonna bring in CM's 
    Extended Desktop implementation. It's stronger and better. But
    had to disable for now as it's not set up with new UI controls.
    
  • Fix rare SystemUI fc caused by Null Pointer on Mobile Data toggle    
        
  • Internals - Bring up feature observers when ECC is foreground, 
    unregister observers when ECC leaves foreground. This is a unique
    feature to Eos! All other builds have about 100 content observers
    running in SystemUI all the time! That's wasting precious CPU
    cycles.       
    
  • This UI overhaul is part of a bigger picture. You will be able to 
    seamlessly and effortlessly transition from one UI style (soon to
    include Pie ;D) regardless of device type.
    
  • Build system - preparation for GCC 4.8 toolchain
  
  • XDA user EvilDobe is now managing bug reports for us. There's too
    many repeat reports coming in. Xoom and TF101 users, DISABLE HOTWORD
    DETECTION PLEASE!!!!!!!!!1 And use a third party keyboard app. Please.

BUG FIX UPDATE ONLY FOR PHONES. 

PHONES

    • Fixed up weird Navigation bar behavior here it would not move
      to landscape and softkeys would disappear. 100% absolutely fixed
      now. This only affected "normal screen" devices, also known
      as "phones" ;D

    • Tuna Series - update LeanKernel to 6.6exp230



=5/20/13=

ALL

  • Fix Airplane mode legacy toggle, but legacy toggles are gone
    for the time being. But they will likely make guest appearances.
    
  • Update wpa_supplicant from CM upstream. Thanks guys.
  
  • Much more work on tablet UI. Still a WIP for sure. Keeping in
    mind, we're not using any form of DPI change. That's for noobs!
    We're using pure logic in configuring and loading resources.
    So this feature will continue to get polished.
    
  • Removed legacy notification toggles. All toggles are now 
    Quick Settings toggles! Added QS toggles to tablet ui.
    
  • Fixed up weird Navigation bar behavior here it would not move
    to landscape and softkeys would disappear. At least i'm 99%
    sure it's fixed ;D


PHONES

  • Enable tablet UI
    This is still a work in progress. There's definately style
    work to do. But it's very fast and very stable and very fun!

  • Nozomi - calibrate WiFi
	     fix torch system-wide
	     latest mako blobs

  • Tuna Series - bring LeanKernel up to v6.5exp230
    
  • Almost done with TabletBar for large and xlarge screen devices. I'm doing

  • Add 5 and 6 column options for quick settings layout
  
  • Performance - enable/disable zram on boot
    Can't do it on the fly without root. We don't want
    to give shared uid system root, so we are exploring 
    making a separate "diagnostics" app where we do any
    root operations.

        · bump LeanKernel to 5.8.2exp1-230 from Imoseyon 

    • All
        · new Swipe to QuickSettings brought in from CM. Swipe

      longpress action, and custom Search Panel target action!
    
    • Introducing version 0.5a (lol) of the all new ECC (Eos Control Center)! 
      For now all users will use view pager in portrait and landscape orientation. 
      In time, tablets will use dual pane interface, large screen (grouper) will 
      use pager in portrait and dual pane in landscape, and phones will 
      use view pager for both. 
      
      Some things to note:
      
        · Some features have been reorganized. You won't have to look far for them.
        
        · Some various layouts are a work in progress. I already know what 
          they are so don't remind me!
        
        · Softkey settings: You can now apply one key's color or glow color to all 
          the keys or glows. With the push of a button. Should satisfy some 
          vocal users ;P
        
        · The ECC will continue to grow and evolve with the goal of the ECC 
          properly reflecting that TeamEos is a world class organization, and 
          the gateway to our features will reflect that.
          No need to wipe or anything else. All your settings are preserved.
